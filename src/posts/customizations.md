### How do I edit content?

Once your site is deployed and configured, add `/admin` to the end of the url (not using localhost) and hit refresh. From there, you should be able to login (then refresh) and see the content management dashboard. You should be able to change most content here (e.g. page text, images, logo, articles, projects, etc.).

### Further customizations

If you want to take your customizations further, you will need to modify the project source code. Fun fun.
